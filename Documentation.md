## Motivation behind the project

The motivation for Medibyte stems from a critical need in the healthcare industry: encouraging patients to actively engage in improving and maintaining their health. Typically, patients undergo medical tests and treatments without any immediate or tangible incentives to follow through on health recommendations or track their progress over time.
Medibyte aims to address this gap by leveraging blockchain technology to create a reward system that provides patients with health tokens based on their test results and health improvements. These tokens act as tangible incentives for patients to follow medical advice and make healthier lifestyle choices.

### The primary goals of Medibyte are:

1.**Incentivize Health Improvements**: By rewarding patients with tokens and dynamic NFTs that reflect their health progress, Medibyte motivates patients to stay engaged with their health management and strive for continuous improvement.

2.**Enhance Patient Engagement**: The reward system fosters a more interactive and engaging experience for patients, encouraging them to regularly participate in health check-ups and follow through on treatments.

3.**Strengthen Patient-Provider Relationships**: Healthcare providers can use Medibyte to build stronger relationships with their patients, enhancing patient loyalty and satisfaction through a system that recognizes and rewards their efforts.
*
Medibyte envisions a healthcare ecosystem where patients are more proactive about their health, leading to better health outcomes and a more efficient healthcare system overall.


## How It Works: Detailed Architecture

### Overview

Medibyte is a web3-based health incentive platform that integrates blockchain technology to reward patients for health improvements. The platform consists of several components: smart contracts, IPFS for data storage, Chainlink services, and a frontend built with modern web technologies. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the architecture and how each part works together:

### 1. Patient Selects Tests and Pays

#### Payment Options
- **On the Same Chain**: If the patient and doctor are on the same chain (e.g., Avalanche), the patient pays for the tests directly to the Health_Contract using USDC.
- **Cross-Chain via CCIP**: If the patient is on a different chain, they can still pay using USDC via Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This involves transferring data along with the tokens, where the data includes a function selector and its arguments.

#### Function: `selectTests`
- The patient calls the `selectTests` function in the `Health_Contract`, passing the selected tests and payment amount.
- The contract stores the test selections in a mapping and logs the patient's details.

### 2. Doctor Uploads Test Results

#### Data Storage on IPFS
- The doctor performs the tests and uploads the results to IPFS, ensuring the data is decentralized and securely stored.

#### Function: `updatePatientHealthScore`
- The doctor then calls `updatePatientHealthScore` in the `Health_Contract`. This function sends a request to Chainlink's Off-Chain Computation (Functions) to process the patient's data.
- The off-chain function retrieves the patient's data from IPFS, calculates the health score, determines the number of health tokens to be awarded, and updates the patient's NFT with a new URI reflecting the updated score.

### 3. Chainlink Off-Chain Computation

#### Data Processing
- Chainlinkâ€™s Off-Chain Computation fetches the patient's data from IPFS via an API.
- It calculates the patient's health score and the number of tokens to award based on the test results.
- It updates the patientâ€™s NFT data, including generating a new URI.

#### Function Response
- The off-chain function returns three values to the `Health_Contract`: `tokensToProvide`, `newUri`, and `healthScore`.

### 4. Updating the Blockchain

#### Callback: `fulfillRequest`
- The `Health_Contract` receives the response through the `fulfillRequest` callback function.
- The contract uses Chainlinkâ€™s log-triggered automation to handle the function call due to gas limitations.

#### Function: `performUpkeep`
- This function is triggered automatically by Chainlink Automation once the response is logged.
- It mints a new NFT for the patient if they don't already have one or updates the existing NFT's URI with the new data.
- It mints health tokens to the patient's address based on their updated score.
- The USDC in the contract is transferred to the doctor.

### 5. Patient Profile and Rewards

#### Patient Profile
- Patients can view their NFTs on their profile page, displaying their health score and available tokens.
- The NFTs are dynamic, updating with each new test result and score.

#### Claiming Rewards
- Patients can claim reward NFTs like `HealthInsuranceNFT`, `FreeHealthKitNFT`, and `FreeHealthCheckupNFT` if they have enough health tokens.
- The claim process involves transferring the required tokens to the doctor and updating the patientâ€™s NFT to reflect the new balance.

**Challenges we ran into**

During the development of Medibyte, we encountered several significant challenges, each requiring dedicated effort and problem-solving:

1. Integration of Offchain Computation: Implementing the offchain computation function posed a major challenge. Despite utilizing the function playground provided by Chainlink, integrating it with our health contract proved difficult. Resolving compatibility issues and ensuring seamless integration demanded extensive troubleshooting and consumed considerable time and effort.

2. Integration of CCIP: Integrating the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) presented another hurdle. This involved facilitating fee transfers between different blockchain networks and transmitting data alongside USDC payments. Overcoming the complexities of cross-chain transactions required meticulous planning and thorough testing to ensure smooth functionality.

3. Integration of Log Triggered Function: Implementing the log triggered function posed its own set of challenges. Initially, we attempted to incorporate the Upkeep function's code within the callback function _fulfillRequest_. However, due to limitations on gas consumption, this approach proved impractical. Subsequently, we transitioned to a log-based triggered function, which necessitated adjustments to our implementation strategy and codebase.

Navigating these challenges demanded perseverance, collaboration, and innovative problem-solving, ultimately contributing to the robustness and resilience of the Medibyte platform.
